This is a very simple example for a Gnome Nautilus Extension that I modified to show that asynchronous menu items are not getting updated.

To compile and install this extension just do

  make

and as root

  make install

restart nautilus by logging out and back in or restart it manually.

To reproduce:

 1. Start up nautilus
 2. Right-click on a file.  The 'Always here' item should be present.  Keep the context menu open.  A timeout will fire after 1 second that generates a second menu item.
 3. My expectation is that the menu item will add a second menu item called 'Sometimes here'.  But nothing is added.  If you clear the context menu and then right-click again you should see the 'Sometimes here' item.
