This is a very simple example for a Gnome Nautilus Extension

I assembled this package because there was no simple compiling example
demonstrating how to develop a C context menu extension for Nautilus.

To compile and install this extension just do

  make

and as root

  make install

restart nautilus by logging out and back in or restarting it manually
and you should see a "Do Foo Stuff" context menu item when you right
click on any file in Nautilus.

For further information see:

All code was blatantly copied from the specification at

  http://taschenorakel.de/svn/repos/bulldozer/tags/release-0.1.0/documentation/NautilusExtensions.html

If you like it and are interested in a more real life example have look at
